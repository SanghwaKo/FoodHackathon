# FoodHackathon

I made this application on Hackathon which was held on 20.07-22.07 in Hamburg.
Our team wanted to make a simple application which helps for users to cook easily.
Many people use internet to get recipes while cooking and there are many applications for it already.
We wanted to make these applications better by offering voice-recognition and TTS services.
When people are cooking, their hands become dirty and they would not want to touch their mobiles.
That is why we made this application! You can touch the screen regardless positions of the screens.
When the voice-recognition dialog pops up just say "Next/After" or "Back/Previous".
Then you can get the next/previous step's instruction.

I am improving the application and I will upload continously when the app has some changes.
